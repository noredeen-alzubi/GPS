# GPS

A small GPS-like application that finds the shortest path between two locations (via Euclidean distance). Uses **Dijkstra's algorithm (a modified breadth-first search)**, which was written from scratch, to find the shortest path. The nodes represent airports in the region; the connections represent available paths between them.
